Negative;@apple What's the point of iCloud wireless updates when ios5 now forces me to use the computer to charge my ipod touch now? #worstupdateever
Negative;@robert_terpstra no worries bud, ps: they're saying that the 4s is having a lot of network issues right now. (I'm @apple for mac problems)

Negative;I sure as hell better be able to restore my calendar events. Terrible bug apple! @apple #icloud #anothericloudfail
Negative;I really hate that @apple won't let you hide the Newsstand app or move it into a folder. It serves no purpose for me.
Negative;Life was much easier when @apple and @BlackBerry were just fruits!
Negative;@apple No location reminders on ipad2! That was the point of updating to iOS 5
Negative;Comparing @Office #live with @google #apps and @apple #iCloud , I do not see #iCloud leading the crowd. Do you agree ?

Negative;This is the first time I've been unhappy with any @apple product... Disappointed, and the Internet seems as confused as I am right now.
Negative;After a week or so with @Apple's #iOS5 I'm considering going back to #jailbroken 4.2 - same features as 5, plus more. Not as stable, though.
Negative;Had issues with #Siri reaching network today. Too many uses or my signal? @apple
Negative;The new iOS5 completely failed at upgrading the phone. Now I'm stuck in this restore loop. Thanks @apple for wasting my day. Can i undo?
Negative;Is it me or does #iPhone4s run a little warm sometimes? @apple
Negative;@apple WTF why can we not add the newsstand to a folder?! We are already in your walled garden, so please don't remind us of it.
